I only put this stuff here so i don't lose it + I kinda want to figure out how Github Works anyways. 

I currently only know that TTS created a line of code in this patch (Trap bug fix).
If i figure out who else made code that i use for my patch i will mention them. 

If you want it to be removed just dm me on Discord, Twitter, Twitch etc. 
I just dont want to rewrite Code if it already exist ay. 

Thank u very much, enjoy.  


The patch (hopefully) fixes the Round 158 bug that makes certain weapon and traps useless, it also 
fixes backspeed and strafespeed.

Everytime you load up a game you will get a full bank and you never have to refill it.

When spawning in you get the most important Permaperks in the game (you can still lose them, but as soon as you restart your match you will
get them back) 

And the most important thing, you spawn with mistys gloves.
